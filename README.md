# Spice_Garden
I created a responsive website named "Spice Garden Restaurant" using Bootstrap 5, CSS3, and HTML. The site, optimized for desktop and mobile, highlighting the menu, ambiance, and promotions. Bootstrap enabled responsive layouts, while CSS3 added custom animations, showcasing my ability to enhance customer engagement and meet business goals.
